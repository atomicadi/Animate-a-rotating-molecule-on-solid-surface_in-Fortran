Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is generally a molecular visualization and analysis computer program widely used in computational chemistry and Biological filed. VMD usually reads all the coordiantes of each step of a system in a single output file (.xyz format) and visualize in a animated format.\
Hare, a molecule of solid surface is rotated and after each rotation a single coordiante file (.xyz form) is generated corrsonding to that rotation. In this .f90 code, each coordiante (.xyz) file of rotated molecule will be opend, read and stored in a single file (.xyz format), name animation file. Finally this animation file will be loaded on VMD to animate the rotaion on computer screen.
