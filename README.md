# Generating an animation file for Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software in Fortran

Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is generally a molecular visualization and analysis computer program widely used in computational Chemistry and Biological filed. VMD usually reads all the coordiantes of each step (eg, Molecular Dynamics, Optimization etc) of a system one-by-one in a single file (.xyz format) and visualize in a animated format.\
Hare, a molecule on solid surface is rotated (example 1) and translated (example 2), and after each rotation/translation a single coordiante file (.xyz format) is generated corresponding to that perturbation. After setting the total number of coordinates file generated after each perturbation, the code (**animation_rotation.f90**) will start in a loop to open, read and store them (each perturbed coordinate file) in a single file (**animation_rotation.xyz**) one-by-one upto that set number. Finally this animation file will be loaded on VMD to animate the change in system on computer screen.
