Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is generally a molecular visualization and analysis computer program widely used in computational chemistry and Biological filed. For animate a rotating molecule on soild surface, here also VMD software is used.\
In this .f90 code, each output.xyz file of rotated molecule will be opend and finally an animation will be generated by VMD.
