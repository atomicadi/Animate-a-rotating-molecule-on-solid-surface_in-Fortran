Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) is generally a molecular visualization and analysis computer program widely used in computational chemistry and Biological filed. VMD usually reads all the coordiantes of each step of a system in a single file (.xyz format) and visualize in a animated format.\
Hare, a molecule on solid surface is rotated and after each rotation a single coordiante file (.xyz format) is generated corresponding to that rotation. After setting the total number of coordinates file for each rotation, the code (**animation_rotation.f90**) will start in a loop to open, read and store them (each rotation coordinates file) in a single file (**animation_rotation.xyz**) one-by-one. Finally this animation file will be loaded on VMD to animate the rotaion on computer screen.
